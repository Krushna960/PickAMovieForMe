                    src="https://www.rogerebert.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spider-Man-No-Way-Home.jpg">
                <p>The best of “Spider-Man: No Way Home” reminded me why I used to love comic books, especially the ones
                    about a boy named Peter Parker. There was a playful unpredictability to them that has often been
                    missing from modern superhero movies, which feel so precisely calculated. Yes, of course, “No Way
                    Home” is incredibly calculated, a way to make more headlines after killing off so many of its event
                    characters in Phase 3, but it’s also a film that’s often bursting with creative joy.</p>

                <p>Director Jon Watts and his team have delivered a true event movie, a double-sized crossover issue of
                    a comic book that the young me would have waited in line to read first, excitedly turning every page
                    with breathless anticipation of the next twist and turn. And yet they generally avoid getting
                    weighed down by the expectations fans have for this film, somehow sidestepping the cluttered traps
                    of other crowded part threes. “No Way Home” is crowded, but it’s also surprisingly spry, inventive,
                    and just purely entertaining, leading to a final act that not only earns its emotions but pays off
                    some of the ones you may have about this character that you forgot.</p>

                <p>Note: I will very carefully avoid spoilers but stay offline until you see it because there are going
                    to be landmines on social media.</p>

                <p>“No Way Home” picks up immediately after the end of “Spider-Man: Far From Home,” with the sound of
                    that film’s closing scene playing over the Marvel logo. Mysterio has revealed the identity of the
                    man in the red tights, which means nothing will ever be the same for Peter Parker (Tom Holland).
                    With an almost slapstick energy, “No Way Home” opens with a series of scenes about the pitfalls of
                    super-fame, particularly how it impacts Peter’s girlfriend M.J. (Zendaya) and best bud Ned (Jacob
                    Batalon). It reaches a peak when M.I.T. denies all three of them admission, citing the controversy
                    about Peter’s identity and the roles his buddies played in his super-adventures.</p>

                <p>Peter has a plan. The “wizard” he met when he saved half the population with The Avengers can cast a
                    spell and make it all go away. So he asks Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to make the world
                    forget that Spider-Man is Peter Parker, which, of course, immediately backfires. He doesn’t want
                    M.J. or Ned or Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) to forget everything they’ve been through together, and so
                    the spell gets derailed in the middle of it. Strange barely gets it under control. And then Doc Ock
                    (Alfred Molina) and the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) show up.</p>

                <p>As the previews have revealed, “Spider-Man: No Way Home” weaves characters and mythology from the
                    other cinematic iterations of this character into the universe of the current one, but I’m happy to
                    report that it’s more than a casting gimmick. My concern going in was that this would merely be a
                    case of “Batman Forever” or even “Spider-Man 3,” where more was often the enemy of good. It’s not.
                    The villains that return from the Sam Raimi and Marc Webb films don’t overcrowd the narrative as
                    much as they speak to a theme that emerges in the film that ties this entire series back to the
                    other ones. For a generation, the line about Spidey was “With great power comes great
                    responsibility.” “Spider-Man: No Way Home” is about the modern Peter Parker learning what that
                    means. (It also helps a great deal to have actors like Molina and Dafoe in villain roles again given
                    how the lack of memorable villains has been a problem in the MCU.)</p>

                <p>So many modern superhero movies have confronted what it means to be a superhero, but this is the
                    first time it’s really been foregrounded in the current run of Peter Parker, which turns “No Way
                    Home” into something of a graduation story. It’s the one in which Parker has to grow up and deal
                    with not just the fame that comes with Spider-Man but how his decisions will have more impact than
                    most kids planning to go to college. It asks some interesting questions about empathy as Peter is
                    put in a position to basically try to save the men who tried to kill other multiverse iterations of
                    him. And it playfully becomes a commentary on correcting mistakes of the past not just in the life
                    of Holland’s Parker but those of characters (and even filmmakers) made long before he stepped into
                    the role. “No way Home” is about the weight of heroic decisions. Even the right ones mean you may
                    not be able to go home again.</p>

                <p>Watts hasn’t gotten enough credit in his other two Spider-Man movies for his action and “No Way Home”
                    should correct that. There are two major sequences—a stunner in a mirror dimension in which Spidey
                    fights Strange, and the climactic one—but it’s also filled with expertly rendered minor action beats
                    throughout. There’s a fluidity to the action here that’s underrated as Mauro Fiore’s camera swoops
                    and dives with Spider-Man. And the big final showdown doesn’t succumb to the common over-done
                    hollowness of MCU climaxes because it has undeniable emotional weight. I also want to note that
                    Michael Giacchino’s score here is one of the best in the MCU, by far. It’s one of the few themes in
                    the entire cinematic universe that feels heroic.</p>

                <p>With so much to love about “No Way Home,” the only shame is that it’s not a bit more tightly
                    presented. There’s no reason for this movie to be 148 minutes, especially given how much the first
                    half has a habit of repeating its themes and plot points. Watts (and the MCU in general) has a habit
                    of over-explaining things and there’s a sharper version of “No Way Home” that trusts its audience a
                    bit more, allowing them to unpack the themes that these characters have a habit of explicitly
                    stating. And, no offense to Batalon, turning Ned into a major character baffles me a bit. He always
                    feels like a distraction from what really works here. On the other hand, this is the first of these
                    three films that has allowed Zendaya and Holland’s chemistry to shine. In particular, she nails the
                    emotional final beats of her character in a way that adds weight to a film that can feel a bit airy
                    in terms of performance.</p>

                <p>“Spider-Man: No Way Home” could have just been a greatest hits, a way to pull different projects into
                    the same IP just because the producers can. Some will see it that way just on premise alone, but
                    there’s more going on here than the previews would have you believe. It’s about what historic heroes
                    and villains mean to us in the first place—why we care so much and what we consider a victory over
                    evil. More than any movie in the MCU that I can remember, it made me want to dig out my old box of
                    Spider-Man comic books. That’s a heroic accomplishment.
